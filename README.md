# 🧙‍♀️HNG 13 Frontend Wizards: Build a Testable Profile Card

Welcome to my **Stage 0 submission** 🎉
This project is a **responsive, accessible, and testable Profile Card** built entirely with **semantic HTML, modern CSS, and vanilla JavaScript**.

The design goes beyond the basics it introduces subtle interactivity, animation, and accessibility improvements to make it stand out, while still meeting every testing and structure requirement.

---

##  Overview

The **Profile Card** component is designed to:

* Present a personal profile in a clean, professional layout.
* Demonstrate **HTML semantics**, **CSS responsiveness**, and **JavaScript interactivity**.
* Include specific `data-testid` attributes so automated tests can target and validate every part of the project.

It’s lightweight, mobile-first, and showcases creativity through motion, theme toggling, and elegant layout transitions.

| --------------------------- | ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `data-testid` attributes    | ✔️          | All visible elements include unique test IDs for automated tests.                 |
| Semantic HTML               | ✔️          | Uses `<article>`, `<header>`, `<figure>`, `<nav>`, and `<section>` appropriately. |

| Real-time clock             | ✔️          | Displays accurate milliseconds using `Date.now()` that updates live.              |
| Responsive layout           | ✔️          | Mobile-first design that scales beautifully on tablets and desktops.              |
| Social links                | ✔️          | Open in new tabs with `rel="noopener noreferrer"`.                                |
| Avatar                      | ✔️          | Circular photo with dynamic glow animation and accessible alt text.               |
| Distinct hobbies & dislikes | ✔️          | Redesigned as animated chips for personality and readability.                     |

## 🎨 Design & User Experience

The card sits on a **red gradient background** that complements the user’s avatar (with hints of red) while the main layout remains on a **white base** for clarity.

Additional design perks:

* Animated floating glow around the avatar
* Real-time live clock
* Responsive grid-to-flex layout
* Hover ripple effects on interactive elements
* Accessible focus rings for keyboard users

---

## Tech Stack

* **HTML5** (Semantic structure & accessibility)
* **CSS3** (Flexbox, Grid, transitions, animations)
* **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6)** for:

  * Time updates using `Date.now()`
  * Theme switching (light/dark)
  * Interactive animations

## Testing Notes

### Data Test IDs

Every testable component includes a `data-testid` attribute:

| Element                | data-testid                  |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Profile card           | `test-profile-card`          |
| Name                   | `test-user-name`             |
| Biography              | `test-user-bio`              |
| Current time           | `test-user-time`             |
| Avatar image           | `test-user-avatar`           |
| Social links container | `test-user-social-links`     |
| Each social network    | `test-user-social-<network>` |
| Hobbies list           | `test-user-hobbies`          |
| Dislikes list          | `test-user-dislikes`         |

Automated testing tools (like Jest + Testing Library) can easily query elements using these IDs.

## 💻 How to Run Locally

### Prerequisites

You only need a modern browser (no build tools required).

### Steps

1. Clone the repository

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Anoin12/profile-card.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the project folder

   ```bash
   cd HNG---Stage-0-Task
   ```

3. Open the `index.html` file in your browser

   * On VS Code, you can right-click and select **“Open with Live Server”** (recommended).

4. That’s it 🎉 — your profile card should display with a live clock and responsive layout.

##  Accessibility & Responsiveness Testing

*  Passed keyboard navigation test
*  Focus visible on all interactive elements
*  Responsive across breakpoints (360px → 1440px)
*  Avatar has proper `alt` description
*  Contrast ratio follows WCAG AA standards

---

## Developer Notes

* The **JavaScript clock** updates every second to show current milliseconds dynamically.
* The **theme toggle** uses `localStorage` to remember the user’s preferred theme.
* Hobbies and dislikes are now represented as **animated “chips”** instead of static lists — for a modern, human-centered touch.
* All transitions are smooth and optimized for performance (no layout thrashing).
